Files and scrips for tvheadend suspend and wakeup

## Attention
This files cannot be taken as is, because I (un)load the required DVB kernel modules. This modules may change depening on the DVB hardware one is using. 
Also I store the scrips into my personal folder for easier backup. If you do so as well you need to change the path according to our home directory.

## Install

- Install the service files in /etc/systemd/system
- Install the scrips in the desirec directory
- Change module names and paths according your needs
- Enable the service files

```shell
git clone https://github.com/stesind/tvheadend-suspend.git

```
